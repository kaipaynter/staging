                  In Jungian psychology, the archetypes represent universal
                  patterns and images that are part of the collective
                  unconscious. Jung believed that we inherit these archetypes
                  much in the way we inherit instinctive patterns of behavior.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  The word “archetype” means original pattern.

                  <br />
                  Millions of people around the world know their psychological
                  type, the result of completing the Myers-Briggs Type
                  Indicator® assessment. The MBTI® instrument is a tool created
                  by Isabel Myers based on Carl G. Jung's personality type
                  theories. In this work you can find your mission &amp;
                  purpose, understand life lessons, unlock roadblocks, and get
                  clarity on how to reach success.
